To create this project, I have used HTML, CSS and JS via VS Code. I started with basic html code , then to enhance its appearance I used CSS. I made other pages such as ABOUT ME, CONTACTS etc.
I attached them via links for each page. I also used some JS code to make it more functional and responsive.
I added some of my personal info along with lorem ipsum text to make it more practical. Note- Not all of the info provided in this website is true.
